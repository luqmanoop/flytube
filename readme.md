<p>FlyTube is a browser extension that allows you to watch YouTube (overlayed) without Ad interruptions.</p>

<p>Instead of <b>blocking ads</b>, FlyTube plays them silently in the background & overlays an embedded player for uninterrupted YouTube. This way, you support creators (with Ad revenue) without sacrificing your time watching (skippable/unskippable) Ads.</p>
